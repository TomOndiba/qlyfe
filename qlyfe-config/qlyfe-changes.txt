NEW PLUGINS
	qlyfe_dev_tools
	qlyfe_context
	nop (might not be able to be a plugin) => override views/default/input/access.php
	families (later)


EXTEND PLUGINS
	extend friends - friend confirmations
				   - classified links

=== DEV TOOLS
	- errlog, firebug, sendmail, configure mail() see bap
	- plugin tutorial
	
	
=== INVESTIGATE
	- profile vs. dashboard (why can't board be put there?)
	- failsafe views??
	
=== BUGS
	settings layout from GoogleChrome
	message board post doesn't work (from profile) 
		- no form element see http://elgg/pg/messageboard/[username] for comparison
	
=== FIXED PLUGINS
	- populate user dashboard by default (& default should be fixed in config file)
	- make active plugins fixed (via file)
	- FYI engine/settings.php has db connection info

=== NEW THEME
	- look and feel changes (get a theme and modify it) 
	- remove dashboard
	- widen center aisle

=== NEW PLUGINS
	- later on SEARCH can be a plugin
	- "who can see this"  plugin
	- openid plugin
	- add the photo album (there is already a good existing one to extend)
	- new signup

=== FRIENDS
	- add friend confirmation system

=== CHANGE ACCESS LEVELS to be clists and classifiers (elgglib.php=> ACCESS_FRIENDS..etc)
	- views/default/input/access.php
	- add classifiers

=== ADD CONTEXT + LAYOUT
	- tabs, network/class = classifier
	- TABBED HEADER & Sidebar calls session-> setContext() or another function setClassifier()
	- content of EVERY page should be dependent on the classifier (including 'owner')
	
=== MESSAGE BOARD enhancements... 
	- message board needs to be modified or compeletely redone

=== ADD the magic box
		
=== MOVE DB to the NOP server


THE PLAN
-- extend ELGG and create ELGG plugins so that later on the ELGG network can become our distributed system
	- make tabs plugin.. friends/family/nbh... etc plugins (context)
	- classifiers as a plugin???
